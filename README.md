This repository contains code and tools for performing segmentations of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images using FreeSurfer and analyzing radiomic features using Pyradiomics.

## Description

In this project, we use FreeSurfer to perform segmentations of structures of interest in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. Once the segmentations are obtained, we use Pyradiomics to extract a wide range of radiomic features. 
These are used to quantify and characterize regions of interest and provide additional information about the pathological features of the MRI images.

## Contents
